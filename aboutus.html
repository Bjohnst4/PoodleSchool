				<hr>
				<p style="margin: 10px 30px 10px 30px">We are the School of Poodle Protection. We began our business 10 years ago, in Cleveland, Mississippi. We offer four different classes at our poodle security training school. Details about each of these classes can be found on the Classes/Services page. Our business is run with professionalism and purpose. We train poodles to the highest security standard in town. Our poodle security training school is the best in the area and has trained poodles from all over the Delta.</p>
				<hr>
				<p style="margin: 10px 30px 10px 30px">The Cleveland Poodle Protection Academy was created in 2007. It was initially formed by two former police officers, Officer John Smith and  Officer James Roberts, who both have extensive experience with trained police dogs over the course of their respective law enforcement careers. Utilizing the tools they acquired training K9s in the police force, they decided to give back and begin an academy that would benefit civilians. Thus, the Cleveland Poodle Protection Academy began, and since its inception it has garnered the support of local law enforcement officials who praise the care and hard work that has been put into this organization. Since 2007, the Academy has served customers from all over the Delta, and the yearly number of poodles that come to our academy for training has increased to a record 200 per year. Will your poodle join the Academy?</p>
